# FFManager
A command-line and graphic Firefox customisation tool.  
Currently in a very early stage.

## Planned features
* Applying multiple userchrome customizations (styles, scripts later) at the same time
* Searching, downloading and updating styles through GitHub
* Applying config options based on userchrome package requirements (aka `legacyProfileCustomizations` & others)
* Multi-profile support
